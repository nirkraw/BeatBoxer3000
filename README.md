# Implementation Timeline

- Day 1: Research and implement how to setup a drum machine that on a click or keypress pre-created audio files. Animate keypresses to imitate a pad press. 

- Day 2: Research and implement how to let users record audio. Assign to the appropriate pad. Potentially create a countdown to recording in order to minmize lag. 

- Day 3: Create a recording functionality that can store when a note pad was played and achieve playback functionality. If there is time - store these recordings in a database and create a shareable link. 

# BONUS

- Store recordings in database and have shareable link
